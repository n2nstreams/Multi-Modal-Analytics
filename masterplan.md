App Overview and Objectives

- Purpose: Create a multi-agent system using the langgraph framework to generate real-time vulnerability reports triggered via voice commands.
- Objectives:
- Use a voice assistant (powered by OpenAI’s voice model) to trigger analytical workflows.
- Process data from SQLite (for MVP) and CSV sources, with room for future expansion to other databases.
- Dynamically aggregate and analyze data, selecting the best visualizations based on the query.
- Display beautiful, interactive visualizations on a modern frontend built with Tailwind CSS, shadcn, and TypeScript.
- Prioritize performance, flexible data processing, and robust error handling within each agent.

Target Audience

- Primary Users: Security analysts and IT professionals who need real-time vulnerability reporting.
- Secondary Users: Developers interested in agent-based architectures for dynamic data analytics.

Core Features and Functionality

- Voice Command Interface:
- Users trigger commands (e.g., “run today’s vulnerability report”) through a multimodal voice assistant.
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion via OpenAI’s voice model.
- Multi-Agent Workflow:
- Voice Agent: Captures and converts voice commands to text.
- Query Interpretation Agent: Translates natural language commands into structured queries.
- Data Query Agent: Executes queries on SQLite and CSV sources.
- Data Cleaning Agent: Preprocesses and cleans data.
- Analytics Agent: Performs aggregations, analyses, and selects appropriate visualization methods.

- Fallback/Error Handling: Each agent includes built-in error handling and a feedback loop to re-prompt the user when clarification is needed.
- Dynamic Visualizations:
- Render various types of interactive visualizations in real time.
- Leverage popular libraries such as D3.js, Chart.js, or Plotly to deliver visually engaging insights.

Project Architecture

Backend Components

- Agent Orchestration:
- Managed via the langgraph framework to coordinate workflow.
- Voice Agent:
- Processes voice commands and converts them to text using OpenAI’s model.
- Query Interpretation Agent:
- Parses natural language into structured queries.
- Data Query Agent:
- Connects to SQLite and CSV sources to retrieve the required data.
- Data Cleaning & Analytics Agents:

Conceptual Data Model

- Data Sources:
- SQLite Database:
- Stores vulnerability report data (e.g., timestamps, vulnerability types, severity levels).
- CSV Files:
- Structured to align with the SQLite schema for consistency.
- Intermediate Data Structures:
- Temporary data stores for cleaned, processed, and aggregated information.
- Standardized data models for passing information between agents.

User Interface Design Principles

- Simplicity & Clarity:
- Clean, intuitive layout with emphasis on data and insights.
- Real-Time Responsiveness:
- Immediate visual feedback and dynamic updates.
- Aesthetic Appeal:
- Modern UI components, leveraging Tailwind CSS and shadcn for a sleek look.

- Allow users to explore data through clickable and animated charts.

Security Considerations

- Error Handling:
- Robust error management is built into each agent to ensure smooth operation.
- Data Privacy:
- While data access control is not implemented in the MVP, focus remains on secure handling of user input and voice data.

For Robustness

- Middleware for Enhanced Error Handling & Logging:
Implement middleware layers that wrap your node executions to catch errors, log detailed context, and even retry failed operations. This ensures your workflow can gracefully handle and recover from runtime issues.
- Dynamic Graph Modification:
Consider supporting runtime changes to your graph. This could include dynamically adding or reconfiguring nodes based on real-time conditions or results, which can improve flexibility and scalability.
- Callbacks & Event Hooks:
Adding support for callbacks or event hooks at key points (e.g., before/after node execution) can help with debugging, performance monitoring, and even triggering additional workflows or notifications.
- Visualization & Debugging Tools:
Integrate visual tools that let you inspect and trace the execution of your graph in real time. This could be crucial for debugging complex workflows and ensuring that agents are performing as expected.
- Asynchronous and Parallel Execution:
Enhance the robustness of your workflow by optimizing for concurrency. This means ensuring your agents and nodes can operate asynchronously or in parallel where possible, reducing bottlenecks.
